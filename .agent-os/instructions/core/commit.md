<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md (use mcp__filesystem__read_text_file)
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="status_check">

### Step 1: Repository Status Check

Verify there are changes to commit using MCP git tools.

<status_verification>
USE: mcp__git__git_status to check repository state
IDENTIFY: Modified, added, deleted, and untracked files
DETECT: Staged vs unstaged changes
VALIDATE: Repository is in committable state
ERROR_IF: No changes to commit, merge/rebase in progress
</status_verification>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use mcp__git__git_status to verify changes exist
  VALIDATE: Repository is ready for commit
  ERROR: If no changes or git conflicts exist
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" subagent="git-workflow" name="commit_creation">
