# Create Pull Request Command

## Overview

Create a pull request for completed feature implementation after tasks have been executed and committed.

<pre_flight_check>
EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md (use mcp__filesystem__read_text_file)
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="branch_status_check">

### Step 1: Branch Status Check

Verify that the current branch has commits ready for PR and determine the target branch.

<status_verification>
<current_branch>
CHECK: Current branch is not main/master
VERIFY: Branch has local commits ahead of main
CONFIRM: All changes are committed (working directory clean)
</current_branch>

<commit_status>
VALIDATE: Working directory is clean
CHECK: Local commits exist and are ready to push
VERIFY: No uncommitted changes exist
</commit_status>

<target_branch>
IDENTIFY: Target branch (usually main or master)
CHECK: Target branch exists and is accessible
CALCULATE: Local commits difference with target branch
</target_branch>
</status_verification>

<error_conditions>

- ON_MAIN_BRANCH: "Cannot create PR from main branch"
- NO_LOCAL_COMMITS: "No local commits to create PR with"
- UNCOMMITTED_CHANGES: "Uncommitted changes detected, commit first"
- WORKING_DIR_DIRTY: "Working directory not clean, commit changes first"
  </error_conditions>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Check current git status and branch state
  VALIDATE: Branch has local commits ready for push and PR
  IDENTIFY: Target branch for PR
  CONFIRM: All prerequisites are met
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" subagent="project-manager" name="spec_context_analysis">

### Step 2: Spec Context Analysis

Use project-manager subagent to gather comprehensive context for PR description from spec files and completed tasks.

<branch_to_spec_mapping>
<branch_name_analysis>
PARSE: Current branch name to identify related spec
PATTERN: Extract spec name from branch (remove date prefixes)
EXAMPLE: "git-code-review-command" ‚Üí "2025-08-14-git-code-review-command"
LOCATE: Corresponding spec folder in .agent-os/specs/
</branch_name_analysis>
</branch_to_spec_mapping>

<context_fetcher_request>
ACTION: Use project-manager subagent
REQUEST: "Gather PR context for branch [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]:

            **Required Context:**
            - Spec description from spec.md or spec-lite.md in .agent-os/specs/[SPEC_FOLDER]/
            - Completed tasks summary from .agent-os/specs/[SPEC_FOLDER]/tasks.md
            - Feature objectives and key deliverables

            **Git Context:**
            - Files modified in current branch (compared to main/master)
            - Commit messages from branch history
            - Overall scope of changes

            **Output Format:**
            - Spec Name: [extracted from spec files]
            - Feature Summary: [brief description for PR title]
            - Completed Tasks: [list of completed tasks with descriptions]
            - Key Features: [main features implemented]
            - Modified Files: [list of changed files]
            - Commit Summary: [summary of commit messages]"

PROCESS: Context-fetcher response for PR description generation
VALIDATE: All required information is available
</context_fetcher_request>

<context_requirements>
<essential_context> - Spec name and feature description - List of completed tasks from tasks.md - Key features and deliverables implemented - Files modified in the branch - Commit history summary
</essential_context>

<optional_context> - Testing instructions (if specified in spec) - Breaking changes (if any mentioned) - Dependencies or prerequisites - Technical implementation details
</optional_context>

<fallback_behavior>
IF spec files not found:
USE: Branch name and commit messages for basic context
NOTE: Limited context available, basic PR description will be generated
IF tasks.md not found:
USE: Commit messages to infer completed work
IF no context available:
ERROR: Cannot create meaningful PR description
</fallback_behavior>
</context_requirements>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use project-manager subagent to gather comprehensive PR context
  REQUEST: Spec files, tasks, and git context for current branch
  PROCESS: Returned context into structured format for PR creation
  VALIDATE: Sufficient context available for meaningful PR description
  FALLBACK: Handle missing files gracefully with reduced context
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="3" subagent="git-workflow" name="push_and_pull_request_creation">

### Step 3: Push and Pull Request Creation

Use git-workflow subagent to push the branch and create the pull request with comprehensive description.

<push_and_pr_request>
ACTION: Use git-workflow subagent
REQUEST: "Push branch and create pull request for completed feature: - Current Branch: [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME] - Target Branch: [TARGET_BRANCH] (usually main) - Spec: [SPEC_NAME_AND_PATH] - Completed Tasks: [TASK_SUMMARY] - Key Features: [FEATURE_LIST] - Action: PUSH BRANCH then CREATE PULL REQUEST"
WAIT: For push and PR creation completion
CAPTURE: PR URL for user feedback
</push_and_pr_request>
