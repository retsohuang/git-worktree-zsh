# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-09-worktree-folder-organization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-09
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze Current gwt-create Implementation
- [ ] Review existing `gwt-create` function in `git-worktree.zsh`
- [ ] Document current path construction logic
- [ ] Identify all path-related variables and operations

### 2. Implement Path Organization Logic
- [ ] Add logic to extract project name using `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
- [ ] Add logic to get parent directory using `dirname`
- [ ] Construct worktree container path: "{project-name}-worktrees"
- [ ] Build final worktree path: "{container}/{branch-name}"

### 3. Update Directory Creation
- [ ] Modify directory creation to use organized path structure
- [ ] Ensure worktree container directory is created with `mkdir -p`
- [ ] Update error handling for directory creation failures

### 4. Update Git Worktree Command
- [ ] Pass new organized path to `git worktree add` command
- [ ] Verify all existing git worktree options still work correctly
- [ ] Maintain support for both new and existing branch scenarios

### 5. Error Handling and User Feedback
- [ ] Update error messages to reflect new path structure
- [ ] Add informative output showing where worktree was created
- [ ] Ensure meaningful error messages for permission or creation failures

### 6. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test with new branches (git worktree add new-path new-branch)
- [ ] Test with existing branches (git worktree add new-path existing-branch)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (permission denied, invalid branch, etc.)
- [ ] Test in different directory structures and git repository states
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with existing worktrees

### 7. Documentation Update
- [ ] Update any inline comments in the function
- [ ] Ensure function behavior is clear from code structure
