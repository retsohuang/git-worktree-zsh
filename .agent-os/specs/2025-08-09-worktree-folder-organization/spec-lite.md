# Worktree Folder Organization - Lite Summary

Organize git worktrees into dedicated "{original-project-folder}-worktrees/" directories instead of creating sibling directories directly in the parent directory.

## Key Points
- Creates worktrees in organized subfolder structure: "{project-name}-worktrees/{branch-name}"
- Prevents worktree directories from cluttering the parent projects directory
- Maintains backward compatibility and all existing gwt-create functionality
