> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Core Function Structure and Parameter Validation ✅

- [x] 1.1 Write unit tests for parameter validation and argument parsing
- [x] 1.2 Implement basic `gwt-create` function signature with parameter handling
- [x] 1.3 Add input sanitization for branch names and directory paths
- [x] 1.4 Implement usage help and error messages for invalid arguments
- [x] 1.5 Add validation for git repository context (must be run inside git repo)
- [x] 1.6 Verify all parameter validation tests pass

### 2. Branch Detection and Management Logic ✅

- [x] 2.1 Write tests for local branch existence detection
- [x] 2.2 Write tests for remote branch existence detection
- [x] 2.3 Implement function to check if branch exists locally (`git branch --list`)
- [x] 2.4 Implement function to check if branch exists on remote (`git ls-remote`)
- [x] 2.5 Add logic to determine branch creation vs checkout strategy
- [x] 2.6 Implement branch name sanitization for filesystem compatibility
- [x] 2.7 Add handling for special characters in branch names (slashes, spaces)
- [x] 2.8 Verify all branch detection and management tests pass

### 3. Directory Management and Worktree Creation ✅

- [x] 3.1 Write tests for directory conflict detection and resolution
- [x] 3.2 Write tests for worktree creation with new and existing branches
- [x] 3.3 Implement directory existence checking and conflict prevention
- [x] 3.4 Add logic to determine target directory path (sibling to main repo)
- [x] 3.5 Implement `git worktree add` command execution with proper parameters
- [x] 3.6 Add support for creating new branches during worktree creation
- [x] 3.7 Add support for checking out existing branches into worktrees
- [x] 3.8 Verify all directory management and worktree creation tests pass

### 4. Error Handling and User Experience ✅

- [x] 4.1 Write tests for various error scenarios and edge cases
- [x] 4.2 Implement detection when function is run from within existing worktree
- [x] 4.3 Add comprehensive error messages with suggested remediation actions
- [x] 4.4 Implement progress indicators for long-running git operations
- [x] 4.5 Add color-coded output for success, warning, and error messages
- [x] 4.6 Implement cleanup logic for failed worktree creation attempts
- [x] 4.7 Add validation for filesystem permissions and available space
- [x] 4.8 Verify all error handling tests pass

### 5. Integration, Navigation, and Final Testing ✅

- [x] 5.1 Write integration tests for complete end-to-end workflows
- [x] 5.2 Implement automatic directory navigation after successful worktree creation
- [x] 5.3 Add integration with zsh completion system for branch name suggestions
- [x] 5.4 Test function behavior with various git repository configurations
- [x] 5.5 Performance testing with repositories containing many branches
- [x] 5.6 Cross-platform compatibility testing (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- [x] 5.7 Integration testing with common zsh frameworks and configurations
- [x] 5.8 Verify all tests pass and function meets performance requirements
