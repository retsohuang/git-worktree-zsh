# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-gwt-create-function/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Functionality Details

**Core Function Implementation**
- Function name: `gwt-create` (git worktree create)
- Primary operation: Create new git worktree with intelligent branch handling
- Support for both new and existing branch scenarios
- Automatic directory creation with proper naming conventions
- Integration with existing git repository context

**Command Interface**
```zsh
gwt-create <branch-name> [target-directory]
```

**Behavior Specifications**
- If target directory not specified, use branch name as directory name
- Handle branch name sanitization for filesystem compatibility
- Detect if branch exists locally or remotely
- Create new branch from current HEAD if branch doesn't exist
- Switch to existing branch if it exists
- Navigate to new worktree directory after successful creation

### UI/UX Specifications

**User Feedback**
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Clear success messages with directory path
- Informative error messages with suggested actions
- Color-coded output using zsh color capabilities
- Consistent messaging format across all scenarios

**Error Handling Interface**
- Graceful handling of invalid branch names
- Clear messaging for directory conflicts
- Repository state validation before operations
- Network connectivity issues for remote branch operations
- Permission-related error explanations

### Integration Requirements

**Zsh Shell Integration**
- Function autoloading support
- Tab completion for branch names (local and remote)
- Integration with zsh parameter expansion
- Proper handling of zsh globbing and special characters
- Support for zsh frameworks (oh-my-zsh, prezto)

**Git Integration**
- Utilize native `git worktree add` commands
- Respect git configuration settings
- Handle git hooks and post-checkout operations
- Integration with git aliases and custom configurations
- Support for git submodules if present

**Filesystem Integration**
- Cross-platform path handling (macOS, Linux, Windows/WSL)
- Proper handling of symbolic links
- Directory permission management
- Cleanup of failed operations

### Performance Criteria

**Response Time Requirements**
- Local branch operations: < 2 seconds
- Remote branch operations: < 10 seconds (network dependent)
- Directory creation: < 1 second
- Function loading: < 100ms

**Resource Management**
- Minimal memory footprint during execution
- Efficient cleanup of temporary resources
- No persistent background processes
- Optimal git command usage to minimize repository operations

**Scalability Considerations**
- Handle repositories with large number of branches
- Support for repositories with extensive history
- Efficient operation in repositories with many existing worktrees
- Performance optimization for slow filesystems

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy

**Function Architecture**
1. Parameter validation and parsing
2. Repository state analysis
3. Branch existence detection
4. Directory conflict resolution
5. Git worktree creation
6. Post-creation setup and navigation

**Error Handling Pattern**
- Early validation and fail-fast approach
- Rollback capabilities for partial failures
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error message translation

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for individual function components
- Integration tests with various git repository states
- Edge case testing (special characters, long paths, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking across different repository sizes
