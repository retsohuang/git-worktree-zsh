# gwt-create function - Lite Summary

Create a zsh function `gwt-create` that simplifies git worktree creation by automatically handling branch creation, directory naming, and post-creation navigation. The function will create worktrees alongside the main project repository with directory names matching branch names exactly.

## Key Points
- Automatically creates new branches or uses existing branches for worktree creation
- Creates worktrees in sibling directories with names matching branch names
- Automatically navigates into newly created worktree directory for immediate workflow transition
