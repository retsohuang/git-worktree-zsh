# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: gwt-create function
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Complete

## Overview

Create a zsh function `gwt-create` that simplifies git worktree creation by automatically handling branch creation, directory naming, and post-creation navigation. The function will create worktrees alongside the main project repository with directory names matching branch names exactly.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Create new branch worktree**
As a developer, I want to run `gwt-create feature/new-auth` to automatically create a new branch and worktree so I can immediately start working on the feature in an isolated directory.

**Story 2: Create worktree from existing branch**
As a developer, I want to run `gwt-create existing-branch` to create a worktree from an existing remote or local branch so I can work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts.

**Story 3: Seamless workflow transition**
As a developer, I want the function to automatically navigate me into the new worktree directory after creation so I can immediately start working without additional cd commands.

## Spec Scope

1. **Automatic branch creation**: Create new local branches when they don't exist locally or remotely
2. **Existing branch support**: Handle existing local and remote branches for worktree creation
3. **Directory management**: Create worktrees in sibling directories with names matching branch names exactly
4. **Error handling**: Detect and prevent creation when directories exist, when running inside worktrees, or with invalid branch names
5. **Post-creation navigation**: Automatically cd into the newly created worktree directory

## Out of Scope

- Git worktree removal or cleanup functionality
- Branch deletion or management beyond creation
- Integration with specific zsh frameworks (oh-my-zsh, prezto)
- GUI or visual interface components
- Remote repository management or cloning

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional zsh script**: A working `gwt-create` function in `git-worktree.zsh` that can be sourced and executed
2. **Error handling validation**: Function properly handles edge cases like existing directories, invalid branch names, and worktree context detection
3. **Directory navigation**: Function successfully creates worktree and changes working directory to the new worktree location
