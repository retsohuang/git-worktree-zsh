# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-config-copy-target-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Write comprehensive test cases for config file copy functionality
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for root `.gwt-config` file copying behavior
  - [x] 1.2 Write tests for subdirectory `.gwt-config` file copying with correct target paths
  - [x] 1.3 Write tests for hierarchical config discovery with multiple `.gwt-config` files
  - [x] 1.4 Write tests to verify no duplicate log messages during copying
  - [x] 1.5 Write regression tests to ensure existing functionality remains intact

- [x] 2. Fix file copy target directory calculation logic
  - [x] 2.1 Analyze current `_gwt_copy_config_files` function implementation
  - [x] 2.2 Implement logic to calculate correct target directory based on `.gwt-config` location
  - [x] 2.3 Add path preservation logic for subdirectory structure
  - [x] 2.4 Ensure compatibility with both root and subdirectory config files
  - [x] 2.5 Verify hierarchical config discovery integration works correctly

- [ ] 3. Eliminate duplicate log messages during file copying
  - [ ] 3.1 Identify source of duplicate copy log messages
  - [ ] 3.2 Review logging mechanism in file copy operations
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement deduplication logic for copy messages
  - [ ] 3.4 Ensure log messages remain clear and informative
  - [ ] 3.5 Test log output consistency across different config scenarios

- [ ] 4. Integration testing and validation
  - [ ] 4.1 Test root `.gwt-config` scenario (files copy to worktree root)
  - [ ] 4.2 Test subdirectory `.gwt-config` scenario (files copy to correct subdirectory)
  - [ ] 4.3 Test mixed scenarios with multiple config files at different levels
  - [ ] 4.4 Validate no duplicate log messages in any scenario
  - [ ] 4.5 Verify existing hierarchical config discovery functionality remains intact

- [ ] 5. Documentation and example updates
  - [ ] 5.1 Update relevant documentation to clarify subdirectory config file behavior
  - [ ] 5.2 Update examples to reflect correct file copying behavior
  - [ ] 5.3 Add examples showing subdirectory config file usage
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify all documentation is consistent with implementation

- [ ] 6. Final verification and testing
  - [ ] 6.1 Run all core tests to ensure functionality works correctly
  - [ ] 6.2 Run integration tests to verify end-to-end workflows
  - [ ] 6.3 Run regression tests to ensure no existing functionality is broken
  - [ ] 6.4 Verify all validation criteria from spec are met
  - [ ] 6.5 Confirm all tests pass and implementation is complete
