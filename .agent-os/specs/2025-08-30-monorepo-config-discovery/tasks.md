# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-30-monorepo-config-discovery/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Enhance config file discovery for hierarchical collection
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for `_gwt_find_config_file()` function to collect all config files in hierarchy
  - [x] 1.2 Modify `_gwt_find_config_file()` to walk directory tree from current directory to git root
  - [x] 1.3 Implement directory traversal using `dirname` with loop protection
  - [x] 1.4 Return array of all found config file paths ordered from closest to git root
  - [x] 1.5 Add caching for git root determination to optimize performance
  - [x] 1.6 Handle edge cases like symlinks and permission denied errors gracefully
  - [x] 1.7 Verify all tests pass for hierarchical config discovery

- [x] 2. Implement configuration merging with .gitignore-like precedence
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for `_gwt_merge_configs()` function with various merging scenarios
  - [x] 2.2 Create new `_gwt_merge_configs()` function to handle configuration merging
  - [x] 2.3 Process collected config files from git root to current directory for proper precedence
  - [x] 2.4 Implement include/exclude pattern resolution with closer configs overriding parents
  - [x] 2.5 Add support for exclusion patterns (`!`) with proper precedence across merged configs
  - [x] 2.6 Return final merged list of files/patterns to copy
  - [x] 2.7 Optimize config parsing to avoid redundant file reads
  - [x] 2.8 Verify all tests pass for configuration merging logic

- [ ] 3. Enhance exclusion pattern handling across merged configurations
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for exclusion pattern precedence in merged configurations
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement proper exclusion pattern (`!`) handling in merge function
  - [ ] 3.3 Ensure exclusion patterns from closer configs override parent exclusions
  - [ ] 3.4 Handle complex scenarios with multiple exclusion patterns in hierarchy
  - [ ] 3.5 Test relative path resolution from multiple config file locations
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all tests pass for exclusion pattern handling

- [ ] 4. Add enhanced logging and debugging capabilities
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for enhanced logging output and debug information
  - [ ] 4.2 Add debug output showing all config file paths found during hierarchy traversal
  - [ ] 4.3 Log final merged configuration result when `GWT_DEBUG=1` is set
  - [ ] 4.4 Show precedence order and which patterns came from which config files
  - [ ] 4.5 Provide clear error messages when no config files found in entire hierarchy
  - [ ] 4.6 Handle permission denied errors gracefully with informative messages
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all tests pass for logging and error handling

- [ ] 5. Ensure backward compatibility and integration
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests to verify existing function interfaces remain unchanged
  - [ ] 5.2 Preserve existing function interface and return values for single config scenarios
  - [ ] 5.3 Maintain identical behavior for current directory and git root scenarios
  - [ ] 5.4 Ensure no performance regression for existing single-repo use cases
  - [ ] 5.5 Keep all existing function dependencies and calling patterns intact
  - [ ] 5.6 Update function documentation to reflect new configuration merging behavior
  - [ ] 5.7 Add comprehensive integration tests for monorepo directory structures
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass for backward compatibility requirements
