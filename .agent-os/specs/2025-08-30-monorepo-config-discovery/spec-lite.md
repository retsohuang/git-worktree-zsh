# Monorepo Config Discovery - Lite Summary

Enhance .gwt-config file discovery to support monorepo workflows with .gitignore-like configuration inheritance. The system will collect all .gwt-config files from current directory up to git root and merge them with closer configurations taking precedence, enabling both shared repository settings and project-specific configurations to work together seamlessly.

## Key Points
- Implements hierarchical .gwt-config discovery from current directory to git root
- Enables project-specific configurations in monorepo subdirectories
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing single-repo workflows
