# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the gwt-create function to automatically copy user-specified development files (such as .claude, .agent-os, CLAUDE.md) to new worktrees through a configurable system. Users can configure once which files or directories should be copied, ensuring consistent development environment setup across all worktrees without manual intervention.
