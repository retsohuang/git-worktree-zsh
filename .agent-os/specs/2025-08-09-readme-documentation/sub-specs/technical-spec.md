- Quick start section for immediate value
- Visual hierarchy with proper heading structure
- Alt text for any images or diagrams
- Mobile-friendly formatting
- Search-friendly with clear section headers and keywords

## Approach

### Content Development Strategy
1. **Audit Current State**: Analyze existing README and identify gaps against professional standards
2. **Content Architecture**: Design information hierarchy optimized for different user personas (beginners, power users, contributors)
3. **Example-Driven Documentation**: Create realistic, tested examples that demonstrate real-world usage patterns
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Structure content so users can quickly find what they need without overwhelming newcomers

### Implementation Methodology
- Use markdown linting tools (markdownlint) to ensure consistent formatting
- Implement automated link checking to prevent broken references
- Create reusable content snippets for consistent messaging across sections
- Establish content review process with technical accuracy verification

### Quality Assurance Process
- **Technical Review**: All code examples and installation instructions tested on clean environments
- **User Experience Review**: Documentation flow tested with representative user scenarios
- **Accessibility Review**: Screen reader compatibility and mobile responsiveness verification
- **SEO Optimization**: Keyword research and content structure optimization for discoverability

## External Dependencies

### Documentation Tools
- **Markdown Processor**: GitHub-flavored Markdown (no additional dependencies)
- **Badge Services**: shields.io for status badges and project metrics
- **Link Validation**: markdown-link-check or similar for automated link testing
- **Syntax Highlighting**: GitHub's built-in Prism.js integration

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Shell Testing**: bats-core for testing installation and usage examples
- **Environment Testing**: Docker containers for testing across different zsh configurations
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated documentation testing and validation

### Content Dependencies
- **License Information**: Current project license file for accurate legal information
- **Version Data**: Git tags and release information for version compatibility matrices
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmarking data for performance claims and comparisons
- **Community Feedback**: GitHub issues and discussions for troubleshooting content and FAQ sections

### Design Assets
- **Diagrams**: ASCII art or simple diagrams for workflow illustrations (no external image dependencies)
- **Icons**: Unicode symbols or GitHub emoji for visual hierarchy and engagement
- **Code Formatting**: Consistent code block styling with appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
