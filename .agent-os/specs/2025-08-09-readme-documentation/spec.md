# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: README Documentation for Open Source Release
> Created: 2025-08-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a comprehensive README.md file for the git-worktree-zsh project to prepare it for open source release, including complete installation instructions, usage documentation, contribution guidelines, and all necessary documentation for both users and contributors.

The README should serve as the primary entry point for developers discovering the project, providing clear value proposition, installation steps, usage examples, and contribution pathways. This documentation will enable immediate adoption and reduce maintainer support burden.

## User Stories

### Open Source User Story
As a developer discovering the git-worktree-zsh project, I want to quickly understand what the tool does, how to install it, and how to use it, so that I can evaluate whether it meets my needs and start using it immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user should be able to read the README and within 5 minutes understand the project's purpose
- Clear installation steps that work across different environments (macOS, Linux)
- Working examples that demonstrate core functionality
- Troubleshooting section for common installation/usage issues

### Contributor Story  
As a potential contributor to the git-worktree-zsh project, I want clear guidelines on how to contribute, development setup instructions, and coding standards, so that I can submit quality contributions that align with the project's goals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The contributor should be able to set up a development environment from README instructions alone
- Clear coding standards and project architecture explanation
- Step-by-step contribution workflow from fork to pull request
- Testing procedures and validation requirements

### Maintainer Story
As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation that reduces support burden by answering common questions and providing troubleshooting guidance, so that I can focus on development rather than repetitive support.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- FAQ section addressing common user questions
- Clear scope definition of what the project does and doesn't do
- Community support channels and issue reporting guidelines
- Performance guidance and best practices

## Spec Scope

### 1. Complete Installation Guide
- **Manual Installation**: Direct file download and zsh configuration
- **Package Manager Integration**: Instructions for homebrew, apt, yum where applicable
- **Zsh Framework Integration**: oh-my-zsh, prezto, zinit, and antigen setup
- **Verification Steps**: How to confirm successful installation
- **Uninstallation**: Clean removal instructions

### 2. Comprehensive Usage Documentation
- **Core Function Documentation**: Complete API reference for all functions
- **Common Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios with step-by-step examples
- **Advanced Usage**: Power user features and customization options
- **Integration Examples**: How to use with existing git workflows
- **Performance Considerations**: Best practices for large repositories

### 3. Development and Contribution Guidelines
- **Development Environment Setup**: Local testing and validation procedures
- **Architecture Overview**: Code organization and function relationships
- **Coding Standards**: zsh best practices, naming conventions, error handling
- **Testing Procedures**: How to run tests and validate changes
- **Contribution Workflow**: Fork, branch, commit, and PR process

### 4. Troubleshooting and Support
- **Common Issues**: Installation problems, permission errors, compatibility issues
- **Debugging Guide**: How to diagnose problems and gather information
- **Performance Troubleshooting**: Handling large repositories and slow operations
- **Community Support**: Where to get help, report bugs, and request features
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Supported zsh versions, git versions, and operating systems

### 5. Project Marketing Content
- **Value Proposition**: Clear explanation of benefits and use cases
- **Feature Highlights**: Key functionality that differentiates from alternatives
- **Comparison Section**: How it compares to other git worktree tools
- **Success Stories**: Example workflows that demonstrate value
- **Professional Presentation**: Badges, screenshots, and polished formatting

## Out of Scope

- Creating actual package manager distributions (homebrew formulas, npm packages, etc.)
- Writing automated installation scripts beyond basic shell commands
- Creating video tutorials or external documentation sites
- Implementing new features not already present in the codebase
- Creating GitHub templates (issue/PR templates) - these would be separate tasks
- Multi-language documentation (README translations)
- Integration with external documentation systems (GitBook, etc.)

## Expected Deliverable

### Primary Deliverable
1. **Professional README.md file** ready for immediate open source publication
2. **Complete user onboarding experience** enabling installation and usage within 5 minutes of discovery
3. **Comprehensive contributor guidance** enabling quality pull requests without additional maintainer support

### Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Technical concepts explained in accessible language
- **Completeness**: All user and contributor needs addressed
- **Professional Presentation**: Proper markdown formatting, badges, and visual appeal
- **Actionable Content**: Every instruction should be specific and testable
- **Maintainability**: Structure that supports easy updates as project evolves

### Success Metrics
- New users can successfully install and use the tool following README instructions
- Contributors can set up development environment and submit valid PRs using only README guidance
- Support requests decrease due to comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
- Project appears professional and trustworthy to encourage adoption
