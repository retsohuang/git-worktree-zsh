### Decision

Build git worktree management as native zsh functions rather than a standalone CLI tool or git plugin.

### Context

Multiple approaches were considered for implementing git worktree management:
1. Standalone CLI tool (Go, Rust, or Node.js)
2. Git plugin/extension
3. Zsh functions and completions
4. Shell-agnostic script collection

### Rationale

- **Native Integration**: Zsh functions provide seamless shell integration without external dependencies
- **Lightweight**: No compilation or runtime dependencies beyond standard tools
- **Customizable**: Users can easily modify and extend functions for their workflows
- **Performance**: Direct shell execution is faster than spawning external processes
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing zsh frameworks and configurations
- **Distribution**: Simple to install via sourcing, package managers, or framework plugins
