# Monorepo Config Discovery - Implementation Recap

**Spec Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Spec File**: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-30-monorepo-config-discovery/spec.md`

## Overview

Successfully implemented hierarchical .gwt-config file discovery and merging system to support monorepo workflows with .gitignore-like configuration inheritance. The system now collects all .gwt-config files from current directory up to git root and merges them with closer configurations taking precedence.

## Key Features Implemented

### Hierarchical Config Discovery
- Enhanced `_gwt_find_config_file()` function to walk directory tree from current directory to git root
- Implemented directory traversal using `dirname` with loop protection
- Added git root caching for performance optimization
- Returns array of all found config file paths ordered from closest to git root
- Graceful handling of edge cases like symlinks and permission denied errors

### Configuration Merging with .gitignore-like Precedence
- Created new `_gwt_merge_configs()` function for configuration merging
- Processes collected config files from git root to current directory for proper precedence
- Implements include/exclude pattern resolution with closer configs overriding parents
- Supports exclusion patterns (`!`) with proper precedence across merged configs
- Optimized config parsing to avoid redundant file reads

### Enhanced Exclusion Pattern Handling
- Proper exclusion pattern (`!`) handling across merged configurations
- Exclusion patterns from closer configs override parent exclusions
- Complex multi-level exclusion pattern scenarios supported
- Relative path resolution from multiple config file locations

### Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- Debug output showing all config file paths found during hierarchy traversal
- Logs final merged configuration result when `GWT_DEBUG=1` is set
- Shows precedence order and which patterns came from which config files
- Clear error messages when no config files found in entire hierarchy
- Graceful permission denied error handling with informative messages

### Backward Compatibility
- Preserved existing function interface and return values for single config scenarios
- Maintained identical behavior for current directory and git root scenarios
- No performance regression for existing single-repo use cases
- All existing function dependencies and calling patterns intact

## Technical Achievements

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Complete backward compatibility maintained
- **Performance Optimized**: Git root caching and efficient traversal algorithms
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Developer Friendly**: Enhanced debugging with detailed logging capabilities

## Files Modified

- `git-worktree.zsh` - Core config discovery and merging implementation
- `test/unit/test_config_parsing.bats` - Comprehensive test suite (523 lines)
- `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-30-monorepo-config-discovery/tasks.md` - All 28 tasks marked complete

## Commits

- `788c866` - feat(config): implement hierarchical config discovery and merging
- `157384b` - feat(logging): add enhanced debugging and error handling capabilities  
- `1e1891c` - feat(tasks): complete task 3 - enhance exclusion pattern handling
- `db964db` - fix(config): suppress stderr output in config discovery calls

## Impact

This implementation enables seamless monorepo workflows where developers can have project-specific .gwt-config files in subdirectories that automatically merge with repository-wide configurations. The .gitignore-like precedence system ensures that local project settings override parent settings while maintaining all shared configurations, significantly improving the developer experience in monorepo environments.

## Next Steps

With monorepo config discovery complete, the project can now focus on further Enhanced UX improvements from Phase 2 of the roadmap, including workflow automation and intelligent defaults.
